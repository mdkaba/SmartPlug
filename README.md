# SmartPlug

The Smart Plug is an AC mains feed-through (similar to a power bar) that monitors power consumption and gives user access to turn it on/off remotely. 

The Smart Plug enables users to gather data surrounding their power use. With this information, they are able to make decisions as to connect and disconnect their devices remotely in order to be as energy conscious as they desire. Users gain the ability to turn on their outlets when they desire as well. For example, if you’re running home late you can turn a light on for your pet to make sure they aren’t left in the dark.
